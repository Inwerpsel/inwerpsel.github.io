This is the first blog post making use of Jekyll to generate a static site for blog posts.

It's mostly a test but also a warning.
Expect the site to be riddled with default content and minor issues for the foreseeable future.
It will probably be at least partially broken half of the time.

## Let's do a little Jekyll first impressions review while we're here

### What I like
* Works pretty well out of the box once installation is done.
* Result seems lightweight.
* Has a lot of features.
* Mostly nice and simple representation of content.

### What I don't like
* Installation process for GitHub pages is complicated and concrete steps are scattered among many pages.
* Using Ruby adds a ton of complexity if you're also using modern JavaScript based build tools.
* It puts dependencies into some random folder on your system (like if you would always install node deps with `-g`).
* Pages in the root folder among other stuff is messy.
* You have to type links at the bottom, name them, and can't do it inline? That's terribly inconvenient.

Here's a demo of my repo: [use-theme-editor][myrepodemo]
